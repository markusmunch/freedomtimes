# Editorial style: English copy for a global audience (French context)

Use this for **Freedom Times** pieces that cite French media, institutions, or untranslated French terms. Goal: an **English-speaking reader** who does not follow France day-to-day still knows **what a name is**, **why it matters**, and **what is at stake**.

---

## 0. Typography (Freedom Times English articles)

- Do not use bold: no markdown `**…**`, no HTML `<strong>`, and no Portable Text `strong` marks in article body or excerpt (calmer typographic voice).
- Italics are fine: `<em>`, markdown `*…*`, and PT `em` marks for light emphasis, titles of works, and glosses.

---

## 1. Hoist stakes in the opening (do not bury the “why it matters”)

After the human lede, add **one short paragraph** (or extend the **excerpt**) that answers, in plain English:

- **What is being alleged** (at the right level of generality; distinguish **allegations** from **findings**).
- **Why the story matters beyond gossip** (e.g. enforcement, professional rules, institutional accountability, protection of children, independence of justice from privilege).
- **That investigations and broadcasts are not courts** — avoid implying a verdict.

Readers should not have to scroll to a later section to understand **impact**.

---

## 2. French outlets and brands (first mention)

Use **name + role** on **first substantive mention** in the body (excerpt counts if the outlet appears there).

| Name | Gloss (pick one length to fit tone) |
|------|-------------------------------------|
| **France Inter** | *France Inter* (major **French public radio** station; **Radio France**) |
| **France Info** / *franceinfo* | **France Info** (France’s **rolling public news** service; **Radio France**) — prefer **France Info** in copy; retain *franceinfo* in URLs only. |
| **France 3 Régions** | **France 3 Régions** (regional **public television**, **France Télévisions**) |
| **ARTE** | **ARTE** (Franco-German **public broadcaster**) |
| **Libération** | **Libération** (major **French daily** newspaper) — optional if context is obvious |
| **La Tribune Dimanche** | **La Tribune Dimanche** (Sunday **opinion** section of the French business daily **La Tribune**) |

**France Inter vs France Info:** *Inter* = broad news, culture, and in-depth programmes; **France Info** = continuous news wire style. One clause is enough.

---

## 3. Other French terms (general rule)

1. **First use:** short gloss in **parentheses** or an **appositive**: *the **Conseil d’État** (France’s highest administrative court)*.
2. **Bodies and acronyms:** *the **CNIL** (France’s data-protection authority)*.
3. **Legal “bar”:** in English, **“the bar”** usually means the **legal profession**, not a café — gloss if ambiguity is likely (*lawyers’ professional body*, *disciplinary proceedings for lawyers*).
4. **Longer explanations:** use the **French `blockquote` + English `<details>`** pattern below (canonical for this site). Do not invent ad‑hoc HTML; follow the block order exactly.

---

## PT pattern: French `blockquote` + English translation expander (canonical)

This is the **only supported shape** for “show the French line, hide the English gloss behind a disclosure”. It matches the **Norway Supreme Court flagship** posts and `buildPortableRenderNodes` in **`web/src/lib/content/contentBlocks.ts`** (patterns in **`web/src/lib/content/translateDetails.ts`**). A legacy client-side upgrade exists in **`web/src/lib/content/contentEnhancements.ts`** for old imports that stuffed the tags into a single paragraph; **new authoring should not rely on that.**

### Block order in the `content` array (strict)

1. **`blockquote`** — **French only** (the line you want visually quoted: guillemets, excerpt, etc.). No fake HTML here; use a real PT block with `style: "blockquote"`.
2. **`normal`** — one span: **`<details class="translate">`** (literal text). **`translation` is not supported** — use **`translate`** only (matches Norway Supreme Court flagship PT).
3. **`normal`** — one span: **`<summary>Show English translation</summary>`** (literal text). Prefer this exact summary markup so the parser extracts the label reliably.
4. **`normal`** — English gloss as **plain body copy** (one or more spans; **do not** prefix with `English:` inside the fold unless editorially necessary).
5. **`normal`** — one span: **`</details>`** (literal text). **Required.** Without this dedicated closing block, the sequence is not recognised and the tags render as dumb paragraphs (including a visible `</details>` line).

Anything before step 1 stays in ordinary `normal` / `h2` / etc. blocks; anything after step 5 continues the article as usual.

### Minimal example (shape only)

```json
{
  "_type": "block",
  "style": "blockquote",
  "children": [{ "_type": "span", "text": "« …French line… »", "marks": [] }]
},
{
  "_type": "block",
  "style": "normal",
  "children": [{ "_type": "span", "text": "<details class=\"translate\">", "marks": [] }]
},
{
  "_type": "block",
  "style": "normal",
  "children": [{ "_type": "span", "text": "<summary>Show English translation</summary>", "marks": [] }]
},
{
  "_type": "block",
  "style": "normal",
  "children": [{ "_type": "span", "text": "…English gloss…", "marks": [] }]
},
{
  "_type": "block",
  "style": "normal",
  "children": [{ "_type": "span", "text": "</details>", "marks": [] }]
}
```

At render time the server emits a real **`<blockquote>`** for step 1, then **`<details class="legacy-details translate">`** (see **`web/src/components/content/EntryBody.astro`**) wrapping **only** the English body from steps 3–4 (the synthetic open/summary/close lines are consumed, not printed). Older pages may still carry the class **`translation`** on `<details>` for styling only; **new PT must use `class="translate"`** in the sentinel block.

### Do not

- Put the French line **inside** the `<details>…</details>` synthetic blocks (use **`blockquote` first**, as above).
- Omit the **`</details>`** block or merge it into another paragraph.
- Replace `<summary>…</summary>` with only `<em>Show English translation</em>` unless you accept the fallback parser path (fragile).

## 4. Checklist before publish

- [ ] Excerpt states **stakes** (allegations vs law, institutions, public interest).
- [ ] **France Inter** and **France Info** (and other cited outlets) glossed on first pass.
- [ ] **Allegations** framed without **prejudging** outcomes.
- [ ] URLs may stay French-domain; **visible labels** use the English-forward names above.
- [ ] Any **French + English translation** pair uses the **canonical `blockquote` + `<details class="translate">` block order** above (including the final **`</details>`** block).

---

## Portable Text: `audio` vs `video` embeds

- **`_type: "video"`** (`Video.astro`) — **Video**: YouTube / watch URLs, generic video iframes, or `<video>` for direct media files under EmDash.
- **`_type: "audio"`** (`Audio.astro`) — **Audio / podcast players**: Apple Podcasts (`embed.podcasts.apple.com`), Spotify embed URLs, other `https` iframe players, or `<audio>` for direct `.mp3` / `.m4a` / etc. Do **not** use `video` for podcast web players.

Fields (both): typically **`url`**, **`alt`** (or `title` for `Audio` fallback). Optional **`aspectRatio`** applies only to **`video`**.

---

## Applying edits to staging (Portable Text)

1. Export the **current** live `data` (MCP `content_get` or admin) so `content` is not shorter than production reality.
2. Edit the tracked patch under **`web/.emdash/article-patches/<slug>.json`** (`slug` + `data` object).
3. Run **`node web/scripts/merge-staging-post-from-patch.mjs posts <slug>`** (uses MCP for `_rev`, merges `data`, then `emdash content update` + `publish` on staging). The script **refuses** if the patch has **fewer** `content` blocks than live unless **`MERGE_STAGING_ALLOW_CONTENT_SHRINK=1`**.
